# Binary-Mix-Azeotropic-Behavior



These are codes I prepared for a physical chemistry lab session in 2018 so I don't have to use the VBA my professor provided, and because I enjoyed doing it as I just figured out how to brute force stuff and wanted to write algorithms :)

The two codes take input some known parameters for two components and predicts how the vapor-liquid equilibrium will look like in terms of the one of the components composition as a function of the temperature.

One of the code does the calculations without any activity coefficient, thus not predicting any azeotropic behavior at all (which differs from reality). The second code takes in activity coefficient and correctly, albeit only qualitatively (for now at least), the existence of azeotropic points. At least it did for the mixture of methanol and carbon tetrachloride I did the experiment on.


I will add more on the README once I refresh my memory by reading the report. I will also add comments inside the MATLAB code to make it easier to follow. 

Cheers
